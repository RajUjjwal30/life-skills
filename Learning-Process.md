## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
In this video, i found the story of "How brain processes information" interesting.

It says that stepping away or relaxing isn't just a break from learning—it is actually a functional part of the learning process itself.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- Active Mode: Thoughts move quickly but stay in a very tight, familiar space. This is great for things I already know, like basic math.

- Diffuse Mode: This is like a machine where the bumpers are far apart. When relaxing, thoughts can travel much further and make connections between wildly different ideas. This is essential for solving new, difficult problems.

## According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? 
- Practice for at least 20 hours
- Deconstruct the skill
- Learn enough to self-correct
- Remove barriers to practice

The actions that I can take to improve my learning process are mentioned in the points below :
- The 20-Hour commitment
- Apply Pomodoro Technique
- Remove "Low-Willpower" Barriers
- Embrace "Hiker" Thinking
- Interleave my practice
- Prioritize physical movement
