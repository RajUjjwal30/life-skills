# IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

## Definition :
"X as a Service" is defined for any Buiness model in which a product is offered as a subscription-based service rather than owned and maintained by the user.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the cloud computing model where the provider provides computing resources such as storage or network servers , etc over the internet.
    

## Why IaaS ?
Suppose I have developed a backend system/project on my local machine but I want other people to use it then I have to put my machine at a place where it should be accessible for everyone to use it.
### How can we do that ??

Here comes the Infrastructure as a Service to my rescue.

I can rent virtual machines/servers or storage so that I don't need to worry about all the physical machines or where I will keep my machines or how many of them are needed that are required to host my project. 
In my case, all I have to do is to go to AWS(Amazon) or Google or any other service provider website and put all the cofigurations that I need, pay according to the services or their charges or my requirements and woohoo...
It is made available to the world without any worry.

It saved my money, time and effort to buy physical machines, rent offices and hire people to maintain them.
